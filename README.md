# prompt_collector
This is a small python app to scrape, sort and organize writing prompts, using tkinter for the UI and SQLite for a database.

It is meant as a learning exercise to practice IU designing, SQL database, and asynchronous or multithreaded programming. Code might not be optimal, and learners are rather advised to consult official resources.


## Usage
Use the console to navigate to the folder where you downloaded the code. Then, type
```bash
main.py
```
and gaze in wonder as an unfinished mess of a tkinter window appears.

## Roadmap for V0.02
-  Finish a functional welcome screen
-  Implement "Look for exchanges" function
-  Implement "Scrape exchange" function
-  Implement exchange/prompt display screens
